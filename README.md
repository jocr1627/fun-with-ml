# Welcome!
My name is John Cronk. I am a software engineer located in the Pittsburgh, PA area. This repository is meant to demonstrate a portion of my skillset as a software engineer. You can also take a previous portfolio piece here: https://github.com/jocr1627/social-learning.

The rest of this project is contained in 3 other repos:
* Apollo Server https://github.com/jocr1627/fun-with-ml-server
* Python Server https://github.com/jocr1627/fun-with-ml-backend
* GraphQL to Typescript https://github.com/jocr1627/fun-with-ml-schema

# Live Demo
The app is hosted using Heroku. You can access it [here](https://fun-with-ml.herokuapp.com/).
* Database is regularly cleared.
* If other users are using the application, you may find the server is busy.

# Technologies
The app is built using the following technologies:
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Database)
* [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/) (Machine Learning)
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) (Server & Client)
* [websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (Subscriptions)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) (User Interface)
* [Clarity](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/) (UI Components)

# Application
This application allows a user to build an RNN model and generate text via the UI.

* Users can create a new RNN model.
